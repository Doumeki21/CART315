#Game Analysis: Okami

Okami was one of my favorite games on the Wii console when it first came out. While my gaming experience was limited, it had unique game mechanics and gameplay like no other. 
The game is set in Nippon, where you are controlling a godly wolf called Amaterasu. Her tail is shaped like a brush which you can use to **draw** attacks on enemies. As a young teen, being able to manipulate my surroundings by drawing a sn at night to create day, slicing enemies with a stroke of a brush, and bombing walls. Thus, the Celestial brush mechanic provides for a very dynamic play, both for combat and solving puzzles.


Pros:
Celestial brush mechanic that changes the world.
wii console motion works well with the dash of the wolf.
the comedic pissing mechanic thats could actually be used as an attack on enemies.

CONS:
Sometimes the camera isnâ€™t too good in small spaces for exploration.
long cutscenes.

What captured me the most was the dynamism of the game mechanics. The use of brush strokes to mark your attacks on the enemies on screen was just so different and creative compared to your average button mash combat. Not only were they used for combat, but also for mundane actions for solving puzzles in the game. like the manipulation of environment (light, weather, elements)
