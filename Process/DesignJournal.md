# Game Analysis: Okami

Okami was one of my favorite games on the Wii console when it first came out. It's a game that falls into a mix of action, adventure, platform, and puzzle game genres. While my gaming experience was limited, it had unique game mechanics and gameplay like no other. For context, the story is set in Nippon, where you are the reincarnated God called Amaterasu, controlled as a wolf. The premise of the game is to collect all the brush techniques that you have lost and use them to fight off evil. 

## Interesting Points
- The brush mechanic
  - Her tail is shaped like a brush which you can use to **draw** attacks on enemies. As a young teen, being able to manipulate my surroundings always fascinated me. You could draw a sun at night to create day, slice enemies with a stroke of a brush, slow time, or break through walls by dropping bombs. Even though you can "punch and kick" like in a typical combat, the celestial brush provides for a dynamic play, both for combat and solving puzzles.
  - As a bonus, you can even sprout trees to stun enemies or pee on them to receive extra rewards. The incorporation of humor adds to the charm of Okami!
- Another interesting point is that most of the time, the difficulty of the game isn't about trying to survive, but about getting more rewards by ridding enemies the quickest and most **skillfully** as possible.

## Flaws
 - Due to the amount of possible brush techniques (13+), some similarities of brush techniques should be avoided to cause frustration in gameplay when the system misinterprets the brush strokes. For example, Veil of Mist to slow time and Whirlwind to create a tornado.

## For Inspiration...
- To incorporate some of these ideas in my future projects, I'd like to consider variety in gameplay. For example, I could be matching different actions to each of their corresponding opponents' colors or introduce different characters that have different playing styles. (And if I do have time, I'd like to think a bit more about the choice of visual narrative.)
