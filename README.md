Learning Unity ◉‿◉

---

Folder notes (**to fix when I have time**):
- Hues of You (failed) version has the hover animation working, but the canvas layer is somehow covered by something... So UI from canvas isn't showing in game screen.
  - Reminder: double click the color wheel to unhide the wheel.
- Hues of You folder has the tooltip working while hovering the color wheel. 
  - Remove it(?) after implementing it in final project.
  - OR move it in an extra/ unused scene in Final Project to **save more space.**
